# Explanation of the Palindrome Number Code

## Problem Overview
The task is to determine whether a given integer `x` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example:
- `121` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- `-121` is not a palindrome (it reads as `121-` backwards).
- `10` is not a palindrome (it reads as `01` backwards).

## Approach
To solve the problem without converting the integer to a string, we can use mathematical operations to reverse half of the number and then compare it with the other half.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The first check determines if the number is negative or ends with a zero (and is not zero itself). 
   - A negative number cannot be a palindrome, and any positive number that ends in zero (except for `0` itself) cannot be a palindrome because the reversed version will start with a zero.

2. **Reversing the Number**:
   - We initialize a variable `reversedNumber` to `0`.
   - The loop continues as long as `x` is greater than `reversedNumber`.
     - This allows us to reverse only half of the number.
   - Inside the loop:
     - We add the last digit of `x` to `reversedNumber`. This is done by multiplying `reversedNumber` by `10` and adding `x % 10` (which gives the last digit of `x`).
     - Then, we remove the last digit from `x` by performing integer division by `10`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After the loop, we check if `x` is equal to `reversedNumber` or if `x` is equal to `reversedNumber / 10`. 
   - The second condition is necessary for odd-length numbers, where the middle digit does not affect the palindrome property. For example, in `121`, after reversing, we get `12` which, when divided by `10`, becomes `1`, allowing us to check the first half against the reversed second half.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `true` if the number is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log10(n))
  - The number of digits in the number determines how many times we divide it by `10`. Therefore, the time complexity is logarithmic in terms of the size of the number.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We are using a constant amount of space for the `reversedNumber` and a few other variables, regardless of the input size.

## Conclusion
This approach effectively checks for palindromic integers without converting the number to a string, ensuring both efficiency and clarity in the solution.
