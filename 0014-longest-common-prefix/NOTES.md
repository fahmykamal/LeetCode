​# Explanation of the Longest Common Prefix Code

## Problem Overview
The task is to find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings. A common prefix is a sequence of characters that is shared at the beginning of two or more strings. For example:
- In the array `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`, the longest common prefix is `"fl"`.
- In the array `["dog", "racecar", "car"]`, there is no common prefix, so the result is an empty string `""`.

## Approach
We start by assuming the first string in the array as the initial common prefix. Then, we iterate through the rest of the strings, and for each string, we progressively shorten the prefix until it matches the beginning of the current string. If at any point the prefix becomes an empty string, we return an empty string as there is no common prefix.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input array `strs` is empty (`null` or length 0), we return an empty string immediately, as there are no strings to compare:
     ```java
     if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) {
         return "";
     }
     ```

2. **Start with the First String**:
   - We initialize the `prefix` to be the first string in the array:
     ```java
     String prefix = strs[0];
     ```

3. **Compare the Prefix with Each String**:
   - Iterate over the rest of the strings, starting from the second one:
     ```java
     for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
     ```
   - For each string, check if the `prefix` matches its beginning. If not, progressively shorten the prefix by removing one character from the end until the current string starts with the `prefix`:
     ```java
     while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) != 0) {
         prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length() - 1);
     }
     ```
   - If the `prefix` becomes empty during this process, return an empty string:
     ```java
     if (prefix.isEmpty()) {
         return "";
     }
     ```

4. **Return the Longest Common Prefix**:
   - Once the loop finishes, the remaining `prefix` will be the longest common prefix among all strings in the array. We return this value:
     ```java
     return prefix;
     ```

## Example Walkthrough

### Test Case 1: `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`
- Initial prefix: `"flower"`
- Compare with `"flow"` → Shorten to `"flow"`
- Compare with `"flight"` → Shorten to `"fl"`
- The longest common prefix is `"fl"`.

### Test Case 2: `["dog", "racecar", "car"]`
- Initial prefix: `"dog"`
- Compare with `"racecar"` → No common prefix, so shorten until the prefix is empty.
- Return an empty string as there is no common prefix.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(S)` where `S` is the sum of all characters in the input strings.
  - In the worst case, every character in each string needs to be compared.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as we only use a few variables for storing the prefix and iterating through the strings.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently finds the longest common prefix by progressively shortening the prefix until it matches all strings in the array. It handles cases where no common prefix exists by returning an empty string when necessary.
