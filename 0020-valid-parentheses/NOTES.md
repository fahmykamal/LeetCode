â€‹# Explanation of the Valid Parentheses Code

## Problem Overview
The task is to determine if a given string containing only the characters `()`, `{}`, and `[]` is valid. A string is considered valid if:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

For example:
- `"()"`, `"()[]{}"` are valid strings.
- `"(]"`, `"([)]"` are invalid strings.

## Approach
We use a `Stack` data structure to help track the opening brackets as we traverse through the string. The stack allows us to match each closing bracket with the most recent unmatched opening bracket.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialize a Stack**:
   - We initialize a `Stack` of characters to store the opening brackets as we encounter them in the string:
     ```java
     Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
     ```

2. **Traverse the String**:
   - Loop through each character in the string:
     ```java
     for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
     ```
   
   - If the current character is an opening bracket `(`, `{`, or `[`, push it onto the stack:
     ```java
     if (c == '{' || c == '[' || c == '(') {
         stack.push(c);
     }
     ```

3. **Handle Closing Brackets**:
   - If the current character is a closing bracket `)`, `}`, or `]`:
     - First, check if the stack is empty, which means there is no matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If the stack is empty, return `false` immediately:
       ```java
       if (stack.isEmpty()) {
           return false;
       }
       ```

     - Pop the top of the stack (which should be the matching opening bracket) and check if it matches the current closing bracket. If it does not match, return `false`:
       ```java
       char top = stack.pop();
       if (c == '}' && top != '{') {
           return false;
       } else if (c == ']' && top != '[') {
           return false;
       } else if (c == ')' && top != '(') {
           return false;
       }
       ```

4. **Final Check**:
   - After traversing the entire string, check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, so the string is valid. If the stack is not empty, return `false` as there are unmatched opening brackets:
     ```java
     return stack.isEmpty();
     ```

## Example Walkthrough

### Test Case 1: `"()"`
- Stack starts empty.
- `(` is encountered, so it is pushed onto the stack.
- `)` is encountered, and the top of the stack is `(`, so it matches and is popped.
- The stack is now empty, so the string is valid.

### Test Case 2: `"([)]"`
- Stack starts empty.
- `(` is pushed onto the stack.
- `[` is pushed onto the stack.
- `)` is encountered, but the top of the stack is `[`, which does not match `)`. Therefore, the string is invalid.

### Test Case 3: `"([])"`
- Stack starts empty.
- `(` is pushed onto the stack.
- `[` is pushed onto the stack.
- `]` is encountered, and the top of the stack is `[`, so it matches and is popped.
- `)` is encountered, and the top of the stack is `(`, so it matches and is popped.
- The stack is now empty, so the string is valid.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
  - We process each character in the string exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of characters in the input string.
  - In the worst case, all opening brackets are pushed onto the stack.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently determines whether the string of parentheses is valid by using a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that the brackets are closed in the correct order. The algorithm handles multiple types of brackets (`()`, `{}`, `[]`) and ensures they are nested and closed properly.
