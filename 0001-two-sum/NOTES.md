# Explanation of the Two Sum Code

## Problem Overview
The goal is to find two indices in an array of integers such that their corresponding values add up to a specified target. Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and we cannot use the same element twice.

## Approach
To achieve an efficient solution, we use a HashMap (or dictionary) to keep track of the numbers and their corresponding indices as we iterate through the array.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Imports and Class Definition**:
   - The code begins with the import statement for the `HashMap` class, which is part of the `java.util` package.
   - A class named `Solution` is defined, which contains the method responsible for solving the problem.

2. **Method Definition**:
   - The method `twoSum` takes two parameters: an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. It returns an array of two integers representing the indices of the numbers that add up to the target.

3. **HashMap Initialization**:
   - A new `HashMap` called `map` is created to store each number from the array as the key and its corresponding index as the value. This allows for quick look-up of previously seen numbers.

4. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - A for-loop iterates over the array `nums`, allowing access to each element and its index.
   - For each element, the complement needed to reach the target is calculated as `complement = target - nums[i]`.

5. **Checking for the Complement**:
   - Inside the loop, a check is performed to see if the calculated `complement` exists in the `map`:
     - If the complement is found, this means there is a number previously seen that, when added to the current number, equals the target. The indices of these two numbers are then returned as an array.
     - The first index is retrieved from the map using `map.get(complement)`, and the current index `i` is also included in the result.

6. **Storing the Current Number**:
   - If the complement is not found in the map, the current number `nums[i]` along with its index `i` is added to the `map`. This ensures that any future numbers can potentially find this current number as their complement.

7. **Return Statement**:
   - Although the problem guarantees that there is exactly one solution, the method includes a return statement for an empty array in case no pair is found. This is more of a safeguard.

8. **Main Method for Testing**:
   - A `main` method is provided to test the `twoSum` method with various input scenarios. It demonstrates how the method can be called and how the output is printed to the console.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array exactly once, resulting in linear time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space complexity is O(n) because the HashMap may need to store up to `n` entries in the worst case (when all elements are distinct).

## Conclusion
This approach effectively finds the indices of two elements that sum up to the specified target using a HashMap, ensuring that the solution runs in linear time and adheres to the problem constraints. The code is structured to be efficient and easy to understand, making use of a single pass through the input array.
